### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning
- PowerBI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. 
2. Standardize data formats (e.g., price, color names) 
3. Create derived columns where necessary for better insights (car, model, color, price, price category {when price is above average price is equals “High”, when price is below average price is equals ‘Low”})
   
### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Derive the average price across various models 
2. Derive the color distribution across price categories (High, Low)
3. Derive the car distribution amongst several cars listed in the dataset
4. Derive the distribution amongst various car types

### Insight

1. large portion of listed cars fall into the Low price category, indicating an affordable market.
2. The top five most expensive cars are dominated by luxury brands, especially Lexus and Land Cruiser, showing premium demand.
3. White and black are the most common car colors, reflecting customer preference or stock availability.
4. Lexus leads in total sales value, suggesting it is the most profitable or in-demand high-end brand.

### Recommendations

1. Target Marketing toward customers interested in affordable vehicles, given the large number of low-price listings.
2. Promote Premium Brands like Lexus and Toyota in high-income areas to maximize profit.
3. Inventory Planning: Focus more on stocking popular car colors like white and black.
